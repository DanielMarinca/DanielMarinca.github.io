### CPSC 120

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-daniel-and-grant)

    Lab 5, part 3 was definitely one of my most favorite labs. It was the first lab in which we were first introduced to the game of blackjack. I had no clue how to play the card game prior to the lab, but eventually learned and am now quite fond of it! The lab was quite challenging, but my partner and I persevered until we completed it. I learned how to make use of command-line arguments, such as turning strings into integers. My favorite part about the lab was the use of command-line arguments to help make calculations. It was quite interesting being able to take something from the command-line, turn it into an integer, and apply it to a functioning program.


* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-daniel-and-chriztian)

    Lab 8, part 1 was quite interesting to program because it involved finding palindromes. I knew what palindromes were prior to the lab, but I had no clue how to actually program it. When I went to the lecture, I learned the concept of how to determine whether or not a word was a palindrome. I loved the lab because I had the ability to practice reading files, comparing files, using loops through command-line arguments, and more.

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-daniel-and-partner)

    Lab 10, part 3 was a very interesting lab for me because I find the concept of being able to produce colors from the computer through code being quite intriguing. I've always been fascinated with computer graphics, so my favorite part was actually being able to see the image I coded in. This was the first time I was introduced to the Magick graphics library, which is one I will definitely be using in future projects. I learned many different concepts from that lab, including how to mix and match colors, as well as how to use for-loops to display a gradient image.
